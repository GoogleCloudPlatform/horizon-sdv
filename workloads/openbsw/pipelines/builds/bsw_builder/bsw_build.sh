# Description:
# This script automates the build process for the OpenBSW project, supporting
# multiple targets and unit testing workflows. It sources the environment
# configuration, defines functions for building and testing, and executes
# steps based on the parameters/environment variables.
#
# Features:
# - Builds POSIX and NXP S32K148 targets.
# - Builds, lists, and runs unit tests.
# - Supports post-build command execution.
#
# Usage:
#   This script is intended to be invoked as part of a CI/CD pipeline or
#   manually to perform builds and tests for OpenBSW.
#
# Include common functions and variables.
# shellcheck disable=SC1091
