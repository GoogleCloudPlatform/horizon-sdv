## Horizon SDV - Release 1.0.0 (2025-03-18)    

### Summary
The main objective for Release 1.0.0 is to achieve Minimal Viable Product level for Horizon SDV platform where orchestration will be done using Terraform on GCP with the intention of deploying the tooling on the platform using a simple provisioner. Horizon SDV platform in Rel.1.0.0 supports:

- GCP platform / services.
- Terraform orchestration (IaC).
- IaC stored in GitHub repo and provisioned either via CLI or GitHub actions.
- Platform supports Gerrit to host Android (AAOS) repos and manifests, and allows users to create their own repos.
    - With some pre-submit checks: e.g., voting labels: code review and manual vs automated triggered builds.
    - Will mirror and fork AAOSP manifests repo, and one additional code repo for demonstrating the SDV Tooling pipeline. Locally mirrored/forked manifest will be updated to point to the internally mirrored code repo, all other repos will remain using the external OSS AAOS repos hosted by Google.
- Platform supports Jenkins to allow for concurrent, multiple builds for iterative builds from changes in open review in Gerrit, full builds (manually, when user requests) and CTS testing.
- Platform supports an artefact registry to hold all build artefacts and test results.
- Platform supports a means to run CTS tests and use the Accenture MTK Connect solution for UI/UX testing.
