## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

During developing the OpenBSW workload and test workflow/pipelines, sometimes it may be necessary to delete offline testbenches created for POSIX related test jobs that may have been left in place.

This is not intended for everyday usage, simply a tool when developing tests to ensure that resources can be removed if errors occur during development.

## Prerequisites<a name="prerequisites"></a>

One-time setup requirements.

- Before running this pipeline job, ensure that the following template has been created by running the corresponding job:
  - Docker image template: `OpenBSW/Environment/Docker Image Template`

## Environment Variables/Parameters <a name="environment-variables"></a>

**Jenkins Parameters:** Defined in the groovy job definition `groovy/job.groovy`.

### `MTK_CONNECT_TESTBENCH`

The name of the MTK Connect testbench to remove in offline state.

### `IMAGE_TAG`

Specifies the name of the Docker image to be used when running this job.

The default value is defined by the `Seed Workloads` pipeline job. Users may override to provide a unique tag that describes the Linux distribution and tool chain versions.

## SYSTEM VARIABLES <a name="system-variables"></a>

There are a number of system environment variables that are unique to each platform but required by Jenkins build, test and environment pipelines.

These are defined in Jenkins CasC `jenkins.yaml` and can be viewed in Jenkins UI under `Manage Jenkins` -> `System` -> `Global Properties` -> `Environment variables`.

These are as follows:

-   `OPENBSW_BUILD_DOCKER_ARTIFACT_PATH_NAME`
    - Defines the registry path where the Docker image used by builds, tests and environments is stored.

-   `CLOUD_PROJECT`
    - The GCP project, unique to each project. Important for bucket, registry paths used in pipelines.

-   `CLOUD_REGION`
    - The GCP project region. Important for bucket, registry paths used in pipelines.

-   `HORIZON_DOMAIN`
    - The URL domain which is required by pipeline jobs to derive URL for tools and GCP.

-   `HORIZON_GITHUB_URL`
    - The URL to the Horizon SDV GitHub repository.

-   `HORIZON_GITHUB_BRANCH`
    - The branch name the job will be configured for from `HORIZON_GITHUB_URL`.

-   `JENKINS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`
    - Service account to use for pipelines. Required to ensure correct roles and permissions for GCP resources.
